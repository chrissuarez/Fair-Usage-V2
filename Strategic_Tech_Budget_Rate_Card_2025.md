# **Earned Media Tech Commercial Model: 2025 Strategy**

## **1\. Executive Summary & P\&L Overview**

To ensure financial sustainability and operational clarity, we are separating the department's technology costs into two distinct cost centers: **SEO Infrastructure** and **Digital PR Infrastructure**.

This prevents cross-subsidization (SEO clients paying for PR tools they don't use) and allows for a clearer "Unit Economics" pricing model.

### **2025 Total Liability Snapshot**

| Cost Center | Description | Total 2025 Liability |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **SEO Shared Stack** | Core infrastructure available to all SEO clients (Semrush, Ahrefs, etc.) | **$176,145** |
| **SEO Client-Funded** | Passthrough costs specifically incurred for single clients (Ellos/ORPI OnCrawl) | **$26,469** |
| **Digital PR Stack** | Media relations and outreach tools (Muck Rack, Buzzstream) | **$31,311** |
| **TOTAL TECH LIABILITY** |  | **$233,925** |

## **2\. The SEO Tech Stack & Pricing Model**

### **A. The Cost Basis (The Bill We Must Pay)**

The SEO stack is infrastructure-heavy. Regardless of usage, these fixed costs must be covered by the collective Tech Fees.

| Vendor | Tool Category | 2025 Cost | Note |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Semrush** | Research & AI | **$116,049** | Enterprise License |
| **Google Cloud** | BigQuery / Compute | **$13,400** | **New: Est. 10 Enterprise Accounts** |
| **Ahrefs** | Backlink Research | **$0** | **Cancelled (Legacy)** |
| **Similarweb** | Competitive Intel | **$15,800** | Fixed Annual |
| **Screaming Frog** | Crawling (Local) | **$14,720** | Unlimited local licenses |
| **OnCrawl (JF)** | Crawling (Cloud) | **$11,983** | Shared License for Ad-Hoc audits |
| **Dragon Metrics** | Rank Tracking | **$3,353** | APAC specific |
| **Slick Plan** | UX/Architecture | **$840** |  |
| **TOTAL SHARED** |  | **$176,145** |  |

### **B. Client-Funded Liabilities (Pass-Through)**

These costs are baked directly into specific client retainers. They are P\&L neutral (Revenue \= Cost) but must be tracked to ensure invoicing occurs.

| Client | Vendor | Cost | Funding Status |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Ellos Group** | OnCrawl (Dedicated) | **$22,664** | Covered by Ellos Tech Fee |
| **ORPI** | OnCrawl (Dedicated) | **$3,805** | Covered by ORPI Tech Fee |
| **TOTAL** |  | **$26,469** |  |

### **C. SEO Rate Card & Coverage Logic**

We will use a 4-Tier SKU system. The goal is to distribute the **$176k** shared cost across the client base based on their consumption tier.

| SKU Name | Annual Fee | Target Client | Tool Allocations (Limits) | Clients Needed to Break Even\* |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Tech Starter** | **$2,400** | **Retainers \< $75k** (e.g. ZA/ES) | • **AccuRanker:** 400 Keywords • **Semrush:** 100 Keywords (Project) • **OnCrawl:** 4,000 URLs (Ad-hoc) | 90+ |
| **Tech Essentials** | **$6,000** | Tier C (Retainers $75k-$200k) | • **AccuRanker:** 800 Keywords • **Semrush:** 200 Keywords • **OnCrawl:** 8,000 URLs (Quarterly) | **32** |
| **Tech Pro** | **$12,000** | Tier B (Retainers $200k+) | • **AccuRanker:** 1,500 Keywords • **Semrush:** 300 Keywords • **OnCrawl:** 18,000 URLs (Monthly) | **16** |
| **Tech Enterprise** | \*\*$24,000\*\* | Tier A (Global Strategic) | • **AccuRanker:** 3,000 Keywords • **Semrush:** 400 Keywords • **OnCrawl:** 40,000 URLs (Weekly) • **Cloud:** Included (BigQuery) | **9** |

* *Breakeven Logic: How many clients at this tier alone would be needed to pay the entire $176k bill.*

**Current Portfolio Coverage:**

* We currently have \~15 High-Value clients (Workday, Swarovski, Walgreens, Nike, etc.) whose combined revenue contribution likely exceeds **$180,000**.  
* This means the "Shared Stack" is **fully covered** by the top 20% of clients.  
* **Every "Tech Essentials" ($6k) client sold hereafter is pure profit.**

## **3\. The Digital PR Tech Stack & Pricing Model**

### **A. The Cost Basis**

The Digital PR stack is lean and seat-based. It is highly efficient but requires specific licensing fees.

| Vendor | Tool Category | 2025 Cost | Note |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Muck Rack** | Media Database | **$15,008** | The core "expensive" asset |
| **Cognitive SEO** | Backlink/Brand | **$5,489** |  |
| **CoverageBook** | Reporting | **$3,618** |  |
| **NLA Licence** | Media Rights | **$2,718** | Legal compliance |
| **Buzzstream** | Outreach CRM | **$1,980** |  |
| **Buzzsumo** | Content Trends | **$1,426** |  |
| **Response Source** | Journalist Requests | **$1,072** |  |
| **TOTAL DPR** |  | **$31,311** |  |

### **B. Digital PR Rate Card**

Since PR costs are low ($31k), we do not need complex tiers. We propose a simple **"Access License"** model.

| SKU Name | Annual Fee | Target Client | Value Proposition & Limits |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **DPR Standard License** | \*\*$3,000\*\* ($250/mo) | All PR Clients | • **Muck Rack:** Standard Database Access • **CoverageBook:** Automated Reporting • **Alerts:** Standard Daily Digest |
| **DPR Enterprise** | \*\*$6,000\*\* ($500/mo) | Crisis / High Vol | • **Muck Rack:** Real-time Crisis Alerts • **Buzzstream:** High-Volume Outreach • **NLA:** Extended Rights Access |

**Profitability Analysis:**

* **Breakeven Point:** We only need **11 Clients** on the Standard License ($3k) to pay for the entire Digital PR tech stack.  
* **Current Status:** If we have \>11 PR retainers, the PR department is running its tech at a profit.

## **4\. Implementation Rules & Hybrid Scenarios**

To avoid billing confusion, Sales and Client Services must adhere to these product selection rules.

### **Rule 1: The "Earned Media" Bundle**

If a client buys **both** SEO and Digital PR services, do not charge two separate tech fees.

* **Charge:** **SEO Professional ($12,000)**.  
* **Internal Allocation:** $9,000 to SEO Cost Center / $3,000 to PR Cost Center.  
* **Client Benefit:** They get the "Full Stack" for a bundled price.

### **Rule 2: Client-Specific Tooling (Passthrough)**

If a client requires a dedicated instance (e.g., their own Crawl Cluster like Ellos), this is **not** covered by the Tech Fee.

* **Action:** This must be scoped as a separate line item: "Dedicated Infrastructure Cost".  
* **Margin:** We add a 20% management fee on top of the vendor cost.

### **Rule 3: The "Freemium" Limit**

Clients who refuse to pay *any* tech fee are strictly limited to:

* **SEO:** 100 AccuRanker Keywords (Brand Only), No Semrush Projects, No Crawls.  
* **PR:** Manual Reporting (Excel), No Muck Rack Lists (Google Sheets only).
